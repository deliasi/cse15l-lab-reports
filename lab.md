# Lab Report 1 CSE 15L
Hello class, today I will give a step by step tutorial on how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

## Step 1: installing VScode
<ol>
<li> I already had VS code downloaded on my computer, but the first step must be to access Visual Studio Code on your personal app store or website.
<li> Download at (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow instructions to install.
<li> Once VS code is open, this is what should be shown.

 </li>
      
<li> To remotely access your account, go to terminal in Visual Stuido code. This is done by clicking on the "Go to termianl bar", then clicking "new terminal". 
 </li>

## Step 2:  Remotely Connecting
<ol>

<li> Find your specific account at(https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Once prompted, set new password for your course specific account.
<li> Go to the termianl in VS Code and type "$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu". However, replace the "zz" in the message with letters from your course-specific account.
<li> Enter yes after asked if you want to continue logging in and ensure authenticity! Then, you will be asked to enter your password in order to connect to the your account. 
<li> Once you enter your password and connect, you should see something like this.

## Step 3: Trying Some Commands
<ol>
 
<li> In the termianl, try various commands to get familiar with them all. 
<li> Make sure that you understand why the command gives you the result it does.
<li> If all is correct, you should see something like this when commands are run!

<li> Your results may look different based on the commands you choose, but I reccomend trying ls -lat, ls -a, and cd to begin.
